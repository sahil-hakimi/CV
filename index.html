        <p>
          I am a third year student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science
          in the Software Engineering Stream. I have over 5 years of experience in programming,
          mainly in Object-Oriented Languages such as Java and Python, but I also have experience
          with C and Assembly. I have completed various projects including an Android App with Java and Android Studios,
          Recursive Visual Sudoku Solver in Python, and a Music Sequencer in C that utilises Tree's to represent a musical
          piece with each node containing data for a musical note.
          Outside of Computer Science, I am also a part-time Swim Instructor at the Aqua Fun Academy and spend my free
          time either reading fantasy novels or at the gym staying active.
